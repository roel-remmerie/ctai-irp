[https://leho-howest.instructure.com/courses/27400/assignments/243962?module_item_id=1071019](https://leho-howest.instructure.com/courses/27400/assignments/243962?module_item_id=1071019)
## Introduction

Dear students,

In this assignment, you will submit the outcome of your literature review.

- Literature research (also called literature review)
    - is a method for gathering existing knowledge related to your research question.
- You will find this knowledge in various sources, such as 
    - peer-reviewed journal articles
    - books
    - papers
    - theses
    - online material
- A good literature review
    - is not a simple list or summary of everything available
    - but a critical discussion of the most relevant and up-to-date information

## How to proceed
### Step 1: Preparation
- Take your contract plan and reread it
    - what were the sub-questions again?
- Read a recent publication on your topic
    - to gain a general overview of the field
    - identify the keywords.
- Review the tips from the SMART session.

### Step 2: Collect literature
- Search purposefully for literature and other sources
    - using the right search terms.
- Keep careful track of all consulted sources.
- Use the university databases.
- Use the tips from the Media Hub.

### Step 3: Assess & select literature
- You will likely find a lot of literature.
- Make a selection of the most relevant and highest-quality sources.
    - Relevance: does it align with your problem statement?
    - Quality: consider the author’s expertise and whether the source is recent/current.

### Step 4: Synthesise the literature
- Now that you have gathered relevant literature, process the information as follows:
    - What is the problem and how is the research approached?
    - Which key concepts are central and how are they defined?
    - What are the results and conclusions?
    - What are the strengths and weaknesses?
    - How can you use this research in your own project?
- By analyzing sources this way
    - you will gain a solid picture of the field and how your work relates to it.
- This enables a critical, well-argued discussion of the literature.

## What to submit
- Submit one document divided into the following parts:
    - Short introduction including research question and theoretical sub-questions.
    - List + summary of similar studies (their approach, technological choices, etc.).
    - Comparison of technology choices: strengths and weaknesses.
    - Extensive discussion of the (new) technology you will use.
    - Correct referencing.
- Note: your audience is IT experts. Describe in detail only those aspects that are not in the MCT/CTAI curriculum.

## Readability tips
- Use clear subheadings and paragraphs.
- Use tables and images/figures/charts (with number + title; reference and discuss them in your text).
- Check spelling and sentence structure.

## Can I reuse this document in my bachelor’s thesis?

Yes. If your document meets the requirements, it corresponds to Chapter 2 “Research” of your bachelor’s thesis.

## Assessment rubric

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| Insufficient (0–6) | Essential theoretical elements are not discussed. No or incorrect referencing.
| Limited (7–9) | The theoretical foundation of the thesis is too weak. Technologies are not sufficiently explained. Source quality is also insufficient. |
| Satisfactory (10–12) | A limited number of sources were consulted. All theoretical sub-questions are answered correctly. The reader has sufficient background information. |
| Good (13–15) | A diverse set of sources were consulted (books, websites, podcasts, online courses, …). The review provides a good overview of current technologies. Complete and correct references allow verification. |
| Excellent (16+) | The review is of a high standard: multiple sources are compared and assessed for quality. |

## Looking ahead
- From 5 January 2026 you will begin the technical research. Prepare by:
    - Installing all required software and tools.
    - Gathering all necessary data/models.
    - Exploring new technologies in advance.
- The results of your literature review will help you start your technical research in a structured way.
- Poor technological choices should be largely avoided by then.
- Ensure your choices are well-founded and logical by weighing the pros and cons of the technologies you examined.

## Use of AI

For your written literature report, you may use AI to rewrite passages to improve readability or to fix minor mistakes. You may not use AI tools to write the entire literature report.

Certain AI tools can help analyze sources, summarize them, and even search for them using Deep Research methodologies. This is allowed, but always verify the results critically.
